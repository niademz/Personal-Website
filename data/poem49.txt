Lullaby

Time to rest now; you have had
enough excitement for the time being.

Twilight, then early evening. Fireflies
in the room, flickering here and there, here and there,
and summer’s deep sweetness filling the open window.

Don’t think of these things anymore.
Listen to my breathing, your own breathing
like the fireflies, each small breath
a flare in which the world appears.

I’ve sung to you long enough in the summer night.
I’ll win you over in the end; the world can’t give you
this sustained vision.

You must be taught to love me.
Human beings must be taught to love
silence and darkness.
